# D-PDV
The **Decentralized Personal Data Vault (D-PDV)** is a blockchain-based DApp for secure personal data storage, giving users full control over access. It eliminates centralized risks, enabling fine-grained permissions for third parties. Monetized via user storage fees and third-party access charges, it ensures privacy and transparency.
