# D-PDV
The **Decentralized Personal Data Vault (D-PDV)** is a blockchain-based DApp for secure personal data storage, giving users full control over access. It eliminates centralized risks, enabling fine-grained permissions for third parties. Monetized via user storage fees and third-party access charges, it ensures privacy and transparency.

**Problem Statement**
In the digital age, privacy and data security are major concerns. Centralized platforms such as Google and Facebook collect, store, and monetize user data without giving users control. Data breaches and unauthorized access further compromise personal information, leaving users vulnerable.

**Solution**
The Decentralized Personal Data Vault (D-PDV) is a blockchain-powered DApp that enables users to securely store, manage, and control access to their sensitive personal data—such as identity documents, health records, and financial information. Unlike centralized services, this solution ensures **data ownership remains solely with the user.**

**Key features:**
***Secure Storage:*** Data is encrypted and stored on a decentralized network, eliminating single points of failure.
***Granular Access Control:*** Users can grant or revoke access to specific data for third parties (e.g., apps, companies, healthcare providers) with fine-grained permissions.
***Transparency & Consent:*** Third parties can only access data when explicitly permitted, ensuring privacy compliance.

**Uniqueness & Differentiation**
While some decentralized storage solutions exist, D-PDV offers true user-controlled data sovereignty with seamless third-party integration, allowing businesses and apps to request data access directly from users rather than relying on centralized aggregators.

**Monetization Strategy**
***User Storage Fees –*** Charge users a small fee based on storage usage.
***Third-Party Access Fees –*** Companies pay to access user data (only with user consent), creating a privacy-first data economy.
